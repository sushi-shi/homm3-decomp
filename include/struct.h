// A packed map coordinate. The DC layout (classes.csv: 4 B, three
// members) puts x at offset 0 and BOTH y and z at offset 2 - the
// signature of short-based bitfields, where x:10 fills the first
// 16-bit unit's low bits and y:10 forces a new unit at +2 with z:4
// tucked into that unit's remaining six.
//
// Every retail reader agrees on the widths. searchArray::get_danger_value
// (0x42ed30) and game::get_cell (0x42ed80) both read the field trio as
//   x: dword @ +0, shl 6, movsx ax, sar 6      -> signed 10 bits @ 0..9
//   y: dword @ +2, shl 6, movsx ax, sar 6      -> signed 10 bits @ 0..9
//   z: dword @ +2, shl 2, movsx ax, sar 12     -> signed  4 bits @ 10..13
// and can_take_town (0x428410) builds one the other way round, masking
// the three source bytes with 0x3ff, 0x3ff and 0xf before packing.
