"""Provenance stamps for disposable comparison objects.

Each normalization stage writes ``<output>.stamp.json`` recording the exact
content identity of every input it consumed. A consumer of a normalized
comparison object verifies the whole recorded chain before trusting it, so a
focused raw rebuild can never be silently compared through a stale normalized
copy. A missing stamp is reported as unverifiable rather than silently
accepted; regenerating through ``homm3 build`` writes current stamps.

The stamp is diagnostic provenance for disposable comparison copies only. Raw
compiler and delinker objects remain authoritative for linking and hard gates.
